  Annual High School Programming Contest</h1>

<div>
	<p> Every year, Siena College brings talented students from high schools
	throughout the Albany area to the campus to participate in a competition
	that tests their programming skills and problem solving abilities. Teams of four are 
	given 6-8 problems and asked to solve them using a coded program. 
	The High School Programming Contest takes place in March or April and draws
	anywhere from 8 to 20 different teams.</p>
